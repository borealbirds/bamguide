## Outline

0. Data Structure  
    * description of overall structure (tables)  
    * autodoc to summarize contents of database (number of locations, surveys, years     * what else might we want to know?)  
1. Data cleaning/processing  
    * data I/O, odbc, read/write/load etc  
    * normalizing data types and structure  
    * correcting problematic values, imputation  
    * filter, transform, aggregate, join, and other db verbs   
    * spatial data processing (vector/raster sp/sf objects)  
2. Data analysis  
    * removal, distance sampling, offsets, glm  
    * tree based methods, gbm et al  
    * bias    *variance trade    *off  
    * N    *mixture (multiple and single visits)  
    * ARU stuff  
    * model evaluation/validation (AUC, bias/variance, etc)  
    * hierarchical models  
3. Intepretation, visualization, prediction  
    * understanding coefficients  
    * plotting effect sizes and relationships (conditional/marginal effects)  
    * looking for missing covariates  
    * prediction and prediction error  
    * mapping (projections, color scales, thresholds)  
4. Survey design (~data collection, but informed by all previous chapters)  
    * optimal design, gap analysis  
    * protocol (time, radius)  
5. Reproducibility  
    * how to improve reproducibility of our studies?  
6. Useful Tools  
    * SpaDES  
    * unmarked  
    * Geonetwork  
    * Rmarkdown  
    * Github  
    * GitKraken  
7. BAM operations and procedures guide  
    * orientation/welcome (BAM context, seminal BAM papers, ...)  
    * coauthorship/collaboration on BAM manuscripts, BAM paper proces and timeline  
    * BAM sharepoint, shared drives, etc.  
    * Theme Teams / hierarchical working groups (+ dealing with overlap among projects within and among themes)  
    * Cheat sheet on where to find various types of information  
8. Outreach and product distribution
