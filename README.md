> The BAM guide to the analysis of messy bird data

## Outline

0. Database structure
    * What does a well documented database look like? 
1. Data cleaning/processing
    * data I/O, odbc, read/write/load etc
    *  normalizing data types and structure
    * correcting problematic values, imputation
    * filter, transform, aggregate, join, and other db verbs
    * spatial data processing (vector/raster sp/sf objects)
2. Data analysis
    * removal, distance sampling, offsets, glm
    * tree based methods, gbm et al
    * bias-variance trade-off
    * N-mixture (multiple and single visits)
    * ARU stuff
    * model validation
3. Intepretation, visualization, prediction
    * understanding coefficients
    * plotting effect sizes and relationships (conditional/marginal effects)
    * looking for missing covariates
    * prediction and prediction error
    * mapping (projections, color scales, thresholds)
4. Survey design (~data collection, but informed by all previous chapters)
    * optimal design, gap analysis
    * protocol (time, radius)
5. Outreach and product distribution
